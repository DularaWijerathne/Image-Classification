STEPS

1) You need to import the necessary libraries (e.g., TensorFlow).

2) Create or load your neural network model.

3) Compile the model by specifying an optimizer, a loss function, and evaluation metrics.

4) Finally, use the model.fit method to train the model on your training data, 
specifying the number of training epochs and providing validation data.
