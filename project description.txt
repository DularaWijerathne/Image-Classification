Image Classification with TensorFlow and Keras:

Developed an image classification script using TensorFlow and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), 
utilizing the Keras dataset with ten classifications. Trained the neural network to recognize those and then
applied the model to classify images from the internet, 
demonstrating its real-world applicability and accuracy.
